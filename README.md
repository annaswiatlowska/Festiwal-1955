# Festiwal-1955
Festiwal 1955 is a display typeface inspired by the visual culture of the 5th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Warsaw in 1955. Designed for a Museum of Warsaw exhibition, it offers a subjective interpretation of period lettering, blending socialist-realist classicism with lighter, expressive festival forms.
